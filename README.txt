This is a simple sliding tile puzzle game that is played in the command prompt. 
This game was a project for CIS 221 C++ programming at Harford Community College.
I expanded on the original project by implementing a system that only updates tiles onscreen that have changed from a move. This was done to reduce flickering caused by refreshing the screen after every move.

All the code for the project is located in source.cpp
